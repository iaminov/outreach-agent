```

### 2. Environment Configuration
Set the following environment variables with proper values:

```bash
# Anthropic AI Configuration
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-api-key

# Airtable Lead Management
AIRTABLE_API_KEY=your-airtable-api-key
AIRTABLE_BASE_ID=your-base-id
AIRTABLE_TABLE_NAME=Leads

CLICKUP_API_KEY=your-clickup-api-key
CLICKUP_LIST_ID=your-list-id

# Email Configuration
SMTP_SERVER=smtp.gmail.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USERNAME=your-email@example.com
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-app-password
FROM_EMAIL=your-email@example.com
```

### 3. Lead Data Structure
Ensure your Airtable base contains a table with the following fields:
- `Name`: Lead's full name
- `Company`: Company name
- `Email`: Contact email address

## Usage

### Running the Outreach Campaign
```bash
python main.py
```

The intelligent agent will:
1. **Validate Configuration**: Check all environment variables and API connections
2. **Retrieve Leads**: Fetch lead data from Airtable with error handling
3. **Generate Messages**: Create personalized messages using Claude AI
4. **Send Emails**: Deliver outreach emails with detailed logging
5. **Create Tasks**: Generate follow-up tasks in ClickUp
6. **Report Results**: Provide comprehensive campaign statistics
7. **Performance Metrics**: Display detailed performance analytics
